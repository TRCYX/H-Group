### The Just-In-Time Fix Clue (JIT)

- When performing a _Layered Finesse_ with a _Lie Component_, if the plan is to give a _Fix Clue_ to the _Finesse Target_ card (the "final" card that is to be blind-played), then it is important to wait until the **last** moment to give the _Fix Clue_. This is because after receiving the _Fix Clue_, the player will not play any more blind cards.
- Thus, you should first wait for all of the "good" blind cards to play, and **then** give the _Fix Clue_ to the _Finesse Target_, so that it comes "just in time" before the misplay.
- Alternatively, if the plan is to give a _Fix Clue_ to some **other** card than the _Finesse Target_ (e.g. a number 5 clue to a 5 in the middle of the hand), then the _Fix Clue_ does not necessarily have to be just in time. It can be done early, and the player will know that they have to continue blind-playing cards until they find the _Finesse Target_.
